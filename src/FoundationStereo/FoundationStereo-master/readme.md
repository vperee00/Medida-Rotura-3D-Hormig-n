# Abstract
Tremendous progress has been made in deep stereo matching to excel on benchmark datasets through per-domain fine-tuning. However, achieving strong zero-shot generalization ‚Äî a hallmark of foundation models in other computer vision tasks ‚Äî remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to achieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and accuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth estimation.

**TLDR**: Our method takes as input a pair of stereo images and outputs a dense disparity map, which can be converted to a metric-scale depth map or 3D point cloud.

# Leaderboards üèÜ
We obtained the 1st place on the world-wide [Middlebury leaderboard](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/eval3/) and [ETH3D leaderboard](https://www.eth3d.net/low_res_two_view).

# Installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate foundation_stereo
```

# Model Weights
- Download the foundation model for zero-shot inference on your data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhPebc_mMxWKccrv7pdQLTvXYVcLYpsf?usp=sharing). Put the entire folder (e.g. `23-51-11`) under `./pretrained_models/`.


# Run demo
```
python scripts/run_demo.py --left_file ./assets/left.png --right_file ./assets/right.png --ckpt_dir ./pretrained_models/model_best_bp2.pth --out_dir ./test_outputs/
```
You can see output point cloud.

Tips:
- The input left and right images should be **rectified and undistorted**, which means there should not be fisheye kind of lens distortion and the epipolar lines are horizontal between the left/right images. If you obtain images from stereo cameras such as Zed, they usually have [handled this](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-sdk/blob/3472a79fc635a9cee048e9c3e960cc48348415f0/recording/export/svo/python/svo_export.py#L124) for you.
- We recommend to use PNG files with no lossy compression
- Our method works best on stereo RGB images. However, we have also tested it on monochrome or IR stereo images (e.g. from RealSense D4XX series) and it works well too.
- For all options and instructions, check by `python scripts/run_demo.py --help`
- To get point cloud for your own data, you need to specify the intrinsics. In the intrinsic file in args, 1st line is the flattened 1x9 intrinsic matrix, 2nd line is the baseline (distance) between the left and right camera, unit in meters.
- For high-resolution image (>1000px), you can run with `--hiera 1` to enable hierarchical inference for better performance.
- For faster inference, you can reduce the input image resolution by e.g. `--scale 0.5`, and reduce refine iterations by e.g. `--valid_iters 16`.



# ONNX/TensorRT Inference (Experimental)
To create ONNX models, run:
```
export XFORMERS_DISABLED=1
python scripts/make_onnx.py --save_path ./output/foundation_stereo.onnx --ckpt_dir ./pretrained_models/23-51-11/model_best_bp2.pth --height 480 --width 640 --valid_iters 22
```

We have observed 6X speed on the same GPU 3090 with TensorRT FP16. Although how much it speeds up depends on various factors, we recommend trying it out if you care about faster inference.

This feature is experimental as of now and contributions are welcome!


# FSD Dataset
Coming soon by the end of March. Stay tuned!
